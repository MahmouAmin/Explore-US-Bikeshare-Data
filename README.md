# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

## Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data
- This Python script is written for Project 2 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) professional track and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## How to run the script
- You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder. To install Spyder, you will need to download the Anaconda installer. This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. After downloading and installing Anaconda, you will find the Spyder IDE by opening Anaconda Navigator.

## Datasets
- The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. Some data wrangling has been performed by Udacity's staff before being provided to the students of DAND. Under the permission of Udacity.

>The data is provided by Motivate, which is a bike share system provider for many cities in the United States. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:

- Start Time
- End Time
- Trip Duration (in seconds)
- Start Station
- End Station
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

> The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year
